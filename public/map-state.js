// The map page's shared mutable state, in one place.
//
// app.js used to hold all of this as 14 closure variables, which is
// exactly why it could not be split: every feature area read and reassigned
// them, so moving any one of them out meant threading a getter for each. As a
// single object, a module that needs the current coverage layer just reads
// S.coverageLayer and always sees the live value.
//
// Deliberately a plain mutable object rather than an event-emitting store:
// this is a faithful lift of what the closure already did, and adding change
// notification at the same time would have made it a rewrite instead of a
// move.
